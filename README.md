CaSSAndRA native is a UI for your CaSSAndRA instances that allows you to manage multiple CaSSAndRA instances from a single app.

## Requirements
- You have at least one  [CaSSAndRA](https://github.com/EinEinfach/CaSSAndRA) instance successfully running.
- You have an MQTT server running in your local network (if not, you can use this [guide](https://medium.com/gravio-edge-iot-platform/how-to-set-up-a-mosquitto-mqtt-broker-securely-using-client-certificates-82b2aaaef9c8) to install a Mosquitto server, e.g., on your CaSSAndRA hardware).
- You have an iOS or Android device (Windows, Linux, and macOS support coming soon).

## Installation
### Android:

Go to /builds/Android download for your device compatible apk file and install it.

### iOS:

Use the sideloading method of your choice (e.g., AltStore). You can find the IPA file under /builds/iOS. If you choose AltStore (not AltStore PAL!!!), it makes installing and updating the app especially easy.

To do this, go to Sources in AltStore and add my app store as a possible app source. Simply use this link as the source:
https://eineinfach.github.io/CaSSAndRA_native/builds/iOS/AltStore/altstore.json

From there, you can install the app and will be notified whenever a new version is available.
